 'Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow' is a great place to start ML. I found this book a few months ago and it is well-structured, straightforward and a book meant for total beginners. I have made this repository to keep a log of the notes and codes from the first part of the book. (The first part focuses on Scikit-learn.) 
 
 Prerequisites: 
 1. Basics of Python and writing a code
 2. Familiarity with Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas libraries.
 3. College-level math (linear algebra, calculus, probability)
